# Kodi Addons

I decided to buy another pi which I would use a central media server. I loaded
OSMC onto it and can use it to play steam games, listen to spotify, watch 
Netflix and Prime Video. However, this is still based on a Raspberry Pi. I think
I can do more. So I may make some addons which will be pretty specific to my 
purposes but who knows. Could be useful for someone out there. 

### Projects

+ Google sheets integration - qurry a google sheets page to display information
like annoucements or something.
+ Recipie display (?) - This server has a display near the kitchen. Might as 
  well display something useful while I cook.
